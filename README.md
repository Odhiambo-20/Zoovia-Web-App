## Payment Integration

The application uses Stripe for secure payment processing:

- **Frontend**: Uses `@stripe/stripe-js` for client-side payment handling
- **Backend**: Requires a backend API to create payment intents (see `src/server/api.ts` for reference)
- **Security**: All sensitive operations are handled server-side
- **Validation**: Comprehensive form validation with error handling
